I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Montreal. I am a member of the [Canadian Research Chair on Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/) and the [Research Chair on Electoral Studies](http://www.chairelectoral.com/). My research interests include civic duty to vote, voting behavior, political socialization, and compulsory voting.
