Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. My supervisors are Ruth Dassonneville and Andr√© Blais.

My research interests include political behavior and participation, party competition, political polarization, political extremism, public opinion and policy responsiveness, quantitative methods.

In my doctoral dissertation, I examine why citizens vote, with a focus on citizens' sense of civic duty to vote.

In the first chapter of my doctoral dissertation, I explore how stable is civic duty, a key turnout determinant. In the subsequent chapters, I examine the effect of (1) civic education, (2) compulsory voting, and (3) corruption on civic duty. I find evidence of a high stability of civic duty. Also, civic duty is affected by civic education and compulsory voting, but not by corruption, a short-term contextual factor. As such, civic duty likely constitutes a long-term, stable motivation to vote.

The chapters of my dissertation have been published in International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Electoral Studies, Canadian Journal of Political Science and Election Law Journal. My works have also been published in European Journal of Political Research, Party Politics, Political Behavior and Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties.
