I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. My supervisors are Ruth Dassonneville and Andr√© Blais.

My research interests include political behavior and participation, political polarization, public opinion, and quantitative methods.

In my doctoral dissertation, I examine why citizens vote, with a focus on citizens' sense of civic duty to vote. More precisely, I show that civic duty is a very stable political attitude, which is most affected by long-term factors (e.g., civic education and compulsory voting) but not by short-term ones (e.g., corruption).

The chapters of my dissertation have been published in International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Electoral Studies, Canadian Journal of Political Science and Election Law Journal. My works have also been published in European Journal of Political Research, Party Politics, Political Behavior and Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties.
