Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. 

My research focuses on what drives individuals to the polls, with a focus on attitudinal factors.

My dissertation explores a key turnout determinant; civic duty. More specifically, (1) what does it mean to feel a civic duty to vote, (2) where such belief comes from, and (3) what is the effect of civic duty on voting. 

My previous work has been published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Political Behavior, and Party Politics.

My research has been funded by the [Fonds des Recherches Societes et Cultures du Quebec (FRQSC)](http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/).
