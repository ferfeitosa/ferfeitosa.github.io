Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. 

My research focuses on what explains electoral turnout, with a focus on attitudinal factors.

In my doctoral dissertation, I explore a key turnout determinant; civic duty. More specifically, (1) what it means to feel a civic duty to vote, (2) where such belief comes from, and (3) what effect civic duty has on voting. 

My work has been published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Political Behavior, and Party Politics.
