I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Montreal. I am a member of the [Canadian Research Chair on Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/) and the [Research Chair on Electoral Studies](http://www.chairelectoral.com/).<br/> <br>
I research about one of the most important turnout determinants; civic duty. More specifically, I am interested in what does it mean to feel a duty to vote, where such a belief comes from, and what are the consequences of civic duty to voting and other forms of political participation as well as to a satisfaction with one's decision to vote or abstain in an election. <br/> <br>
Besides civic duty, I also have researched about compulsory voting, correct voting, and voting behavior in general.<br/> <br>
I am a recipient of a doctoral scholarship from the Fonds des Recherches Societes et Cultures du Quebec (FRQSC).<br/> <br>
During the Winter of 2019, I was a visiting scholar at Departement of Political Science from KU Leuven.
