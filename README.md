I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. My research focuses on a key turnout determinant; civic duty. More specifically, I am interested in (1) what does it mean to feel a civic duty to vote, (2) where such belief comes from, and (3) what is the effect of civic duty on voting and other forms of political participation. I am also interested in compulsory voting, correct voting, and voting behavior in general.

My previous work has been published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Political Behavior, and Party Politics. <br/> <br>

My research has been funded by the [Fonds des Recherches Societes et Cultures du Quebec (FRQSC)](http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/).<br/> <br>
