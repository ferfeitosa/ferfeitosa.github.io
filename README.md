Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. My supervisors are Ruth Dassonneville and Andr√© Blais.

My research examines why citizens vote, with a focus on normative considerations.

In the first chapter of my doctoral dissertation, I explore how stable is civic duty, a key turnout determinant. In the subsequent chapters, I examine the effect of (1) civic education, (2) compulsory voting, and (3) corruption on civic duty. I find evidence that civic duty constitutes a long-term, stable motivation to vote. Consistent with the stability thesis, I find that civic education and compulsory voting, an institutional factor, exert an influence on citizens' belief in the duty to vote. By contrast, corruption, a short-term contextual factor, plays no role in that respect.

My work has been published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Election Law Journal, Political Behavior, Party Politics, and Electoral Studies.
