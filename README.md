I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. My research focuses on a key turnout determinant; civic duty. More specifically, I am interested in (1) what does it mean to feel a duty to vote, (2) where such a belief comes from, and (3) what are the consequences of civic duty to voting and other forms of political participation. I am also interested in compulsory voting, correct voting, and voting behavior in general.<br/> <br>

<br/> <br> Previous work has been published or is forthcoming in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Political Behavior, and Party Politics. <br/> <br>

My research has been funded by the [Fonds des Recherches Societes et Cultures du Quebec (FRQSC)](http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/).<br/> <br>
