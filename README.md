I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. I am a member of the [Canada Research Chair on Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/) and the [Research Chair on Electoral Studies](http://www.chairelectoral.com/).<br/> <br>
I research about one of the most important turnout determinants; civic duty. More specifically, I am interested in what does it mean to feel a duty to vote, where such a belief comes from, and what are the consequences of civic duty to voting and other forms of political participation. <br/> <br>
Besides civic duty, I also research about compulsory voting, correct voting, and voting behavior in general.<br/> <br>
I am a recipient of a doctoral scholarship from the [Fonds des Recherches Societes et Cultures du Quebec (FRQSC)](http://www.frqsc.gouv.qc.ca/en/).<br/> <br>
During the Winter of 2019, I will be a visiting scholar at the [Centre for Political Science Research](https://soc.kuleuven.be/centre-for-political-research). <br/> <br>
