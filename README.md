Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal. My supervisors are Ruth Dassonneville and Andr√© Blais.

My research examines why citizens vote, with a focus on normative considerations.

In the first chapter of my doctoral dissertation, I explore how stable is civic duty, a key turnout determinant. In the subsequent chapters, I examine the effect of (1) civic education, (2) compulsory voting, and (3) corruption on civic duty. I find evidence of a high stability of civic duty. Also, civic duty is affected by civic education and compulsory voting, but not by corruption, a short-term contextual factor. As such, civic duty likely constitutes a long-term, stable motivation to vote.

My work has been published in Political Behavior, International Journal of Public Opinion Research, Party Politics, Electoral Studies, and Election Law Journal.
