            <p>This article investigates if civic education can spur a sense of duty to vote and, in this way, help to augment the number of voters 
              and diminish inequality in participation. I perform a systematic cross-country analysis of the link between different forms of 
              civic education and civic duty, using the data from the 2016 International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) that include 
              23 countries. The results show that three key civic education mechanisms—civics courses, active learning strategies and open classroom 
              environment—exert an influence on civic duty but that civics courses have the strongest effect. Country-level analyses confirm that 
              civics courses are more influential on civic duty than the other types of civic education. This evidence elucidates which channels of 
              school socialization may help to develop a sense of duty in adolescents, as well as the relative effect of each mechanism.</p>

            <p>A close connection between public opinion and policy is considered a vital element of democracy. In representative systems, 
              elections are assumed to play a role in realising such congruence. If those who participate in elections are not representative 
              of the public at large, it follows that the reliance on elections as a mechanism of representation entails a risk of unequal 
              representation. In this paper, we evaluate whether voters are better represented by means of an analysis of policy responsiveness 
              to voters and citizens in democracies worldwide. We construct a uniquely comprehensive dataset that includes measures of citizens’ 
              and voters’ ideological (left–right) positions, and data on welfare spending in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 
              countries since 1980. We find evidence of policy responsiveness to voters, but not to the public at large. Since additional tests 
              suggest that the mechanism of electoral turnout does not cause this voter‐policy responsiveness, we outline alternate mechanisms to 
              test in future research.</p>

            <p>Civic duty has been perceived as a key determinant of turnout. That is, while dutiful citizens turn out in large numbers, those who 
              conceive of voting as a choice do less so. The strong correlation between civic duty and turnout might be due to reverse causation, 
              however. Specifically, individuals might adapt their sense of duty according to previous voting behavior. In this article, we leverage 
              Belgium’s compulsory voting system and the age-based discontinuity for the right to vote, and estimate the effects of being treated with 
              participation on civic duty. We do not find “treated” citizens to be more likely to report civic duty than their “non-treated” counterparts. 
              This finding holds across a series of robustness tests, and suggests that civic duty is exogenous to the vote.</p>

          <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p>Corruption is generally associated with low electoral participation. A recurrent explanation of the negative correlation between corruption 
              and electoral turnout involves the rational calculus of the costs and benefits of voting. More specifically, in a context of high 
              corruption, citizens do not vote because they think that doing so will hardly affect policy decisions. A number of influential studies 
              has argued that corruption affects citizens' electoral engagement in a different and more fundamental way as well: It erodes their sense 
              of civic duty to vote in elections. Yet, a relation between corruption and civic duty and a mediation effect of the attitude remains 
              empirically untested. This article examines empirically whether perceived corruption and sense of civic duty are correlated, as well as 
              whether civic duty mediates the relation between perceived corruption and turnout. It does so with the pooled Making Electoral Democracy 
              Work data, as these data contain measures on individuals’ sense of civic duty to vote in four election levels, namely, national, regional, 
              European, and municipal elections, as well as on their perception of corruption in each of these government levels, and on their participation 
              in these four election levels as well. I find a weak relation between perceived corruption and civic duty, and a low mediation effect of 
              the attitude (compared with rational factors), irrespective of the election level.</p>

            <p>Research has established that compulsory voting rules have a strong effect on turnout. There are good reasons to think compulsory 
              voting has such an effect because it leads citizens to feel a stronger sense of civic duty. In this study, we put the link 
              between compulsory voting rules and civic duty to a test by examining whether Chile's abolition of compulsory voting rules, 
              in 2012, affected citizens' belief in the duty to vote. Our results are consistent with the claim that compulsory voting rules 
              strengthen citizens' sense of civic duty to vote, a finding that stands up to several robustness checks.</p>

A Panel Study on the Individual-Level Stability of the Attitude</a>. <em>International Journal of Public Opinion Research</em>. (with C. Galais)</li>
          <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p>Work that includes civic duty among the predictors of electoral participation has generally assumed that civic duty is 
              antecedent to turnout; as such, it affects voting behavior rather than being affected by it. Some studies challenge that 
              view, arguing that, in fact, when asked in the context of a survey, individuals rationalize their perception of the duty to 
              vote based on their previous participation, or not, in elections. In this study, we assess the temporal stability of the sense 
              of civic duty and, by doing so, evaluate whether the public’s perception of civic duty does constitute a plausible antecedent 
              to voting or not. Our results suggest that civic duty attitudes are very stable over time, a finding that stands up in the case 
              of different survey samples, civic duty measures, elections, inconsistent voting behavior, model specifications, and between-wave 
              intervals.</p>

         <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p>Political theorists have argued that democracies should strive for high turnout, leading to an argument for the introduction of 
              compulsory voting, one of the surest ways to increase turnout. Others have warned that this obligation comes at a cost of lower 
              quality votes. We investigate these claims by examining the impact of compulsory voting on proximity voting. First, we examine 
              individuals’ voting behavior in three countries with strong compulsory voting laws: Australia, Belgium and Brazil. Election surveys 
              in these countries include a hypothetical question about the likelihood of voting without legal obligation. We continue with an 
              examination of the effects of compulsory voting in Switzerland, which varies across cantons. Our results support the ‘reluctant 
              voter’ hypothesis: Compelling voters to vote tends to weaken the impact of proximity considerations on electoral behaviour, 
              although this effect remains limited and is only significant in half of the elections that were investigated.</p>

            <p>This article examines people’s assessments, ex post, of whether their decision to vote or to abstain 
              in a given election was the right one. We use 22 surveys conducted in 5 different countries (Canada, France, Germany, 
              Spain and Switzerland) in national, supra-national and sub-national elections between 2011 and 2015. We find that the 
              great majority of those who voted were satisfied with their decision to vote while non-voters were more doubtful about 
              the wisdom of their decision to abstain. We also find that those who are interested in politics, who feel that they have a 
              moral duty to vote in elections, and who feel close to a party are more prone to be satisfied with their decision to vote and 
              to be dissatisfied if they chose to abstain.</p>
